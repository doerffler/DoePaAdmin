# Accounting Control Center (ACC)
This is a tool to manage all kinds of business data a small consulting business faces on a daily base.
It is written by [DÃ¶rffler &amp; Partner GmbH](https://www.doerffler.com), which is a small consulting company based in Hanover, Germany.

# Introduction
This is a Windows application, that solves the following use cases, among others:
- Manages all outgoing and incoming invoices
- Keeps track of your order's budget
- Records projects, orders and time sheets and uses all the data to write invoices
- Defines cost centers, links them to your working force and creates an overview on all expenses
- Keeps an eye on the mailbox, enters contracts, invoices and orders and files them in a sorted manner
- Manages your inventory, links it to cost centers and depreciates it over an individual timespan to keep track of your expenses.

# Getting Started
Since the application is still a work in progress you probably won't be able to use it "out of the box". You might want to start using our "DP-App" web application, which allows your front- and backoffice to collect incoming invoices, write outgoing invoices and have them released by the company's management. You can then import the data from DP-App to DoePaAdmin, to get a better understanding of your expenses and revenues.

# Documentation
At this moment there is no documentation for end users. We'll create a wiki to document all development related stuff. A detailed documentation will be added after the basic development is done.

# Questions
## Why is this a Windows application? I would like to use it on my smartphone, tablet or unix machine!
We started development alongside our main business, so we used the technology we knew best. If there is time or a significant demand for a web based application we'll be happy to work on that as soon as possible.

## Is this software independent of a country? Can I use it for my business based in the United States?
A lot of the stuff in this application (e.g the data model for addresses) is based upon German standards. Additionaly a lot of the UI is labeled in German and not localized. We plan to change that, but it's not our main focus at the moment.
